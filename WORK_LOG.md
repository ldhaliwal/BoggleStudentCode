I think the next step is to flush out my pseudocode approach before I start turning it into actual Java code. |
| January 7 | 8:30-9:25pm | worked on flushing out some more pseudocode but quickly went to just writing. I first wrote the main find words method and though it would be cleanest to make another dfs method so that it could easily recurse and my code would stay neat. I also thought about how to mark things as true or false and made some changes to my old TST code to overload the lookup method to have that added in. Then i worked on the dfs method. I tried running it on some of the test cases, it works on the two smallest ones, but not on the edge case. haven't tried it on the others because I can't figure out how to do the terminal stuff to update the test files. thats a question for tomorrow. I think the main issue is that i forgot to write a thing to check duplicates. oops. another thing for tomorrow. |

FOund that the best way was to make a TST of the good words to go along with the arraylist to minimize lookup times. also switched around the order of the dictionary and duplicate checks to try and shave off some runtime. |
